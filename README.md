### Acyclicity Nature

The Git Commit history is a Directed Acyclic Graph ï¼ˆ"DAG"), where the commits form the nodes and the pointers to the parents from the edges.  The acyclicity property ensures the commit history is well-defined and cannot contain cycles or loops, where parents do not point back to their children



## What is a commit

A commit is a pointer to the location insider the .git folder where Git has stored your changes. Commit object

- Do not use reset

- 
## Useful Commands
- use git branch, git stauts to check open
